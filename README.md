A **very basic app** trying to **recommend a book** based on what the user describes

Limited by the current DB file which containts +- 47k books and their descriptions

The DB file, as well as the keyword mapping pkl file are not included here. How the app works can be seen in the screenshot attached.

FUTURE SCOPE: User filtering through recommendations based on popularity and review score of the books, which is also a feature in the db file. So far it only matches keywords, the similarity metric is to be changed completely. This is just a starting point.

Also the DB file shall be replaced by a better file, obtained through web scrapping bots.
